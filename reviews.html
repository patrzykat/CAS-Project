            <h2 class="text-center my-5">Turkuaz</h2>
            <p class="text-left">This is one of the few restaurants located in Halifax that offers traditional Turkish food with a fine-dining experience... </p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Dining: </b>Turkuaz offers a fine-dining experience with a large seating area, even with the COVID-19 restrictions put in place during the pandemic. Still, the restaurant is a popular choice among individuals from all over Halifax and Bedford, so reserving a spot ahead of time is strongly advised. </p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Food: </b>The food is quite simply amazing. A great amount of time and care is taken for each dish, which shows in both the presentation and the taste. The portions are also quite generous, as per Turkish culture and tradition. </p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Price: $$$</b></p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Parking: </b>Unless a customer is hosting an event, it should not be an issue to get a spot.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center my-5">Grill Way</h2>
            <p class="text-left">If your main goal in visiting mediterranean restaurants is to experience their traditional meat then look no further than Grill Way and Catering. This place doubles as a butchershop, allowing it to produce fresh meat with both good value and taste to rival even the best fine-dining experiences in Halifax.</p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Dining :</b>The indoor and outdoor dining area is highly limited as the restaurant is set up for takeout rather than fine-dining. However, this is actually an advantage as it facilitates reduced prices for food.</p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Food: </b>The food is good enough to rival many of its competitors. The menu itself is not varied as it specializes in meat, but this does not take away from the quality. The beef and lamb are by far their best offerings. The chicken is also good, however, it must be eaten with hummus or garlic sauce to give it the right amount of flavour. Luckily, this is supplied with the food, albeit in quantities that leave something to be desired.</p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Price: $ </b>(This is taking into account the value of what is being purchased. One kilogram of chicken would be $20, which beats out every other restaurant of its kind in the province)</p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Parking: </b>There is a fairly large parking lot which is never full, so this is not an issue.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center my-5">East Coast Bakery</h2>
            <p class="text-left">If you want to purchase high-quality baked goods to be eaten on the spot, then this might be the restaurant that you have been searching for. </p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Dining: </b>There is no indoor or outdoor dining area.</p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Food: </b>The restaurant supplies a variety of baked goods, including bagels, cookies, sourdough bread, challah buns and loaves. Everything is made fresh that day and they are only open for a limited period of time, which benefits the consumer since you will only ever receive fresh, high quality goods.</p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Pricing: $</b></p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Parking: </b>Scarce. It is located on Quinpool, which has few parking spots, but there are spaces in close proximity in side roads and in large parking complexes that can be used. </p>

            <h2 class="text-center my-5">Cacao 70</h2>
            <p class="text-left">Originating from Montreal, this store specializes in high quality chocolate products from chocolate bars to their quadruple chocolate parfaits. This is a must-see store for anyone with a serious sweet tooth. </p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Dining: </b>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this section cannot be reviewed</p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Food: </b>Cacao 70 is able to deliver on only a single front, which is their chocolate. Although this is done well, it takes away from the desserts that they craft in their stores. For example, the quadruple chocolate parfait is nothing special at all. The only thing made by cacao 70 are the brownies, but the ice cream and whipped cream are not in-house creations, taking away from the dessertâ€™s value. Instead, one could simply purchase brownies from the restaurant and make a parfait of equal, if not better quality at home.</p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Pricing: $$</b></p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Parking: </b>Very scarce due to its downtown location, but this allows people to experience the waterfront, which more than makes up for the lack of available parking. </p>

            <h2 class="text-center my-5">Ko-Doraku</h2>
            <p class="text-left">Although Halifax has a number of sushi restaurants due to its location by the ocean, Ko-Doraku offers an experience that can not be found in any other; its indisputable home-like ambience.  </p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Dining: </b>The indoor dining experience does leave anything to be desired. Located in the basement of a mall, the slightly dim lighting combined with the noren (traditional japanese curtains) adds an ambience to the dining experience that is rarely found in other sushi-making establishments. There are also booths located in the very back of the restaurant which offer a high level of comfort and privacy. </p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Food: </b>Ko-Doraku offers multiple different Japanese dishes, including sushi, curry, soups, rice dishes, udon and soba noodles, and many other dishes. Fortunately, we have had the opportunity to try dishes from all of these sections, and nothing has ever left much to be desired. The portions are quite generous, especially for the rice dishes. And the quality of the food is great.</p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Price: $$</b></p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Parking: </b>Scarce, but it is located in the downtown area, so location makes up for this aspect.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center my-5">Charger Burger</h2>
            <p class="text-left">Although Halifax has a number of high quality burger restaurants such as Five Guys and Krave Burger, Charger is the first one to offer a completely halal menuâ€¦</p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Dining: </b>This is generally dependent on the location, however, each restaurant has the same basic aspects. There is usually space for people to sit, however, there are specific peak times when it is advised to be prepared for take-out.</p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Food: </b>Charger Burgerâ€™s menu is quite varied, offering burgers, shawarma, donair, poutine, salads, and fingers. Each option is well-crafted and the chefs are very open to constructive criticism, which is exactly how they developed their recipes to where they are now. The one weakness they have are certainly the fries, which do not have the freshness and crispness expected from a restaurant.</p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Pricing: $$$</b></p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Parking: High availability.</b></p>

            <h2 class="text-center my-5">Chatime</h2>
            <p class="text-left">First opened in Taiwan, the teahouse franchise has made its way around the world due to its rising popularity, eventually making it all the way to Halifax, Nova Scotia.</p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Dining: </b>There is certainly no shortage of places to sit in the store. The majority of the tables have high stools, but there are also lower tables as well. Of course, this is dependent on the location.</p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Food: </b>Chatime offers a wide array of different teas and juices, both hot and cold. They also allow you to choose the ice and sugar in your drinks, as well as the jellies or pearls you would like. This vast menu allows a person who has any kind of taste to enter Chatime and find something they like. And for those who do not discriminate between flavours, it is a dream come true.</p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Pricing: $$</b></p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Parking: Generally low</b></p>

            <h2 class="text-center my-5">Five Guys</h2>
            <p class="text-left"> This fast food chain has its origins in Washington, DC, but due to its popularity was able to reach the far stretches of Canadaâ€™s east coast in Halifax, Nova Scotia.</p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Dining: </b>The restaurant is located right on Argyle street in the exclusively pedestrian area, giving it a great location for sitting. It is also a glass building, allowing customers to eat their food with an outside view. The seating areas are also mostly booths, which gives a high level of comfort.</p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Food: </b>Five Guys offers burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, and their famous milkshakes. All of these offerings are great picks with their own unique aspects and great taste, however, there is one glaring weakness in the restaurant. These are the fries. They are excessively salty, to the point that they are unpalatable even for the most seasoned consumers. This could have also been due to a mistake made in our order when we visited the restaurant, but it is certainly something to keep in mind. </p>

            <p class="text-left">This restaurant is one of the few restaurants in Halifax that offers very high quality burgers in an exceedingly short preparation time compared to its competitors.</p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Dining: </b>The indoor area is very well-kept and there is no shortage of seating. They use incandescent lighting which gives the restaurant a distinctive ambience. The overall dining experience is both solid and nuanced.</p>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Food: </b>The burgers, which are the main attraction, are highly impressive given the prices. There are a variety of different types, each with their own distinct taste that sets them apart from the rest of the menu. Ordering a burger with one of their in-house shakes completes the experience, rivalling that of Five Guys, if not surpassing.</p>
